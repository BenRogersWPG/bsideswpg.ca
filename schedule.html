	  <div class="presentation">
    	    <h4 class="title">InfoSec from an ISP Perspective</h4>
    	    <h5 class="speaker">Theo Baschak</h5>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      Handling Information Security for an established Internet Service
	      Provider (ISP).
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="bio">
	      Theo has been involved with infosec in Winnipeg since moving here
	      approximately a decade ago. He previously ran wpgwifi.com to raise
	      awareness about wireless security before 802.11g became popular.

	  <div class="presentation">
    	    <h4 class="title">Canadian Cyber Defence Challenge: Building a War Zone</h4>
    	    <h5 class="speaker">Jared Bater & Chris Kluka</h5>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      The <a href="http://www.cyberdefencechallenge.ca">Canadian Cyber
	      Defence Challenge</a>, which took place at Red River College on
	      May 13 of this year, was an "event driven, time constrained,
	      full-spectrum cyber defence challenge" for the high school teams
	      that participated. With the leadership of Ian Trump, Jared Bater
	      (MERLIN) and Chris Kluka (Daemon Defense) were charged with
	      building a robust, fully-contained, and high-performing system to
	      support ~70 high-school cyber-defenders at any facility and at
	      short notice.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      The hosting facilities at Daemon Defense and MERLIN at the
	      University of Manitoba would house the games' heavily-virtualized
	      infrastructure, fat pipes to Internet and related
	      research/education and content provider networks. At the game site
	      would be our cyber defenders, red team, support staff, and
	      media. They needed a solid, tightly contained network between the
	      two sites, and an incredibly nimble and highly performing back-end
	      to respond to the high peak usage, time-constrained event.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      The CDC pulled the event together, seemingly out of thin air, by asking for
	      help from Ian Trump. Ian brought Jared and Chris in to provide donated
	      network and server resources. These resources would have easily cost tens
	      of thousands of dollars for the CDC to procure. However, due to their
	      virtualizable nature, they were able to implement enough compute and network
	      resources to provision 144 virtual machines on loaned hardware.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      In this presentation Jared and Chris will show off what they did,
	      and discuss how they can do it better next time.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      The future holds many more demands: an order of magnitude more teams, many
	      more concurrent game sites across Canada, and a need to scale network,
	      security, storage, compute, memory, and operational capability. We plan to
	      heavily leverage virtualized networking, virtualized compute and
	      virtualized storage to stand up an extraordinary game experience for short
	      periods of time, with the ability to do it all again in short order (on the
	      road where needed), all on a reasonable dime.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="bio">
	      Jared is a network design and security guy with a day job in K-12
	      education. He is passionate about diving into the truth that is
	      the packet trace, and about solving real-world problems below
	      layer 8.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="bio">
	      Chris is an IT Systems Infrastructure Architect. He build
	      hypervisor clusters and enterprise networks for professional
	      sports, financial, educational, and content distribution
	      clients. My recent projects have included: the Investors Group
	      Field (the new home of the Winnipeg Blue Bombers), the McMichael
	      Canadian Art Collection (Vaughn, Ontario), the Canadian Museum for

    	    <h4 class="title">Making pen-testing analysis sexy</h4>
    	    <h5 class="speaker">Adrien de Beaupre</h5>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      This presentation will discuss information security penetration
	      testing methodology, and how portions of the test process may be
	      automated. The analysis of test results can be made more efficient
	      through development of additional tools to assist the analyst. The
	      Open Source Security Assessment Management System (OSSAMS) will be
	      presented, which is a framework for the automation, data collection,
	      analysis, and reporting in penetration testing and vulnerability
	      assessment efforts. OSSAMS is written in Python and allows for the
	      processing of tool results, parsing and normalizing the data,
	      extraction of meaningful information via query, and more effective
	      analysis.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="bio">
	      Adrien is a senior Information Security Consultant with Intru-Sca
	      Inc., experienced in penetration testing and incident response. He
	      also holds the ISC2 CISSP, GXPN (GIAC Exploit Researcher and
	      Advanced Penetration Tester), GWAPT (GIAC Web Application
	      Penetration Tester), GPEN (GIAC Penetration Tester), GCIH (GIAC

    	    <h4 class="title">VoIP and VoIP related fraud</h4>
    	    <h5 class="speaker">Leslie Bester</h5>
    	    <p class="abstract">
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="bio">
    	      Les is a telecommunications super hero. He single handedly built,

    	    <h4 class="title">Security in the Open</h4>
    	    <h5 class="speaker">Yvan Boily</h5>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      Yvan will talk about the pitfalls, challenges, and humour of
	      running security in an open source project, including bug bounty
	      programs, funny incidents, and bug reports. Along the way he will
	      also share information that other teams can learn from and the
	      value of being open and honest about security issues.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="bio">
	      Yvan works on building communities in the regions he live
	      in. While in Winnipeg, he ran the OWASP Winnipeg chapter and was
	      involved with IPAM; now in Vancouver, he runs OWASP and
	      participates in teaching the tech community about security.
    	    </p>

	  <div class="presentation">
    	    <h4 class="title">Detecting malicious activity and malware on a large network</h4>
    	    <h5 class="speaker">Brandon Enright</h5>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      This presentation will discuss the sorts of data sources available
	      to network operators and big companies running their network, and
	      how to sort through that data to find abuse, malicious activity, and
	      malware.
	    </p>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      The bulk of the focus of the presentation will be on detecting
	      botnet Command and Control (C&ampC) but will definitely cover drive
	      by exploits and other things too. A big focus will be on transparent
	      HTTP proxy logs (like the stuff you get out of WebSense or BlueCoat
	      or Web Security Appliance) but mining other data sources including
	      passive DNS queries will be covered.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="bio">
	      Brandon got his start in security by contributing to the Nmap
	      project. From 2007&ndash;2011 he did a lot of work on malware and
	      botnet architecture and C&amp;C. This included building a P2P
	      crawler to enumerate and measure the entire Stormworm botnet.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="bio">
	      Brandon also dabbles in cryptography and helped knock two hash
	      proposals out of the SHA-3 hash competition (Spectral Hash and
	      NKS2D).

    	    <h4 class="title">Internet Bots for Fun & No Profit</h4>
    	    <h5 class="speaker">Kyle Geske</h5>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      This talk will cover the creation of bots. Specifically, it will focus
	      on <a href="https://twitter.com/abotlafia">@abotlafia</a>, a Twitter bot
	      inspired by the "bot" in Umberto Eco’s 1988 novel <em>Foucault’s Pendulum</em>.
	      The talk will demonstrate how little code is required to create
	      automated accounts on Twitter. This will be followed by a discussion
	      of the security/ethical implications of algorithmic social media
	      accounts, and the possibility of a future where we are unable to
	      determine who is real and who is a bot on the Internet.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="bio">
	      Kyle is a Winnipeg based computer engineer, web coder, and

    	    <h4 class="title">Auditable Offline Bitcoin Wallet Implementation</h4>
    	    <h5 class="speaker">Mark Jenkins</h5>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      Motivations for operating an offline bitcoin wallet will be
	      explained and security risks associated with obtaining and relying
	      on such software will be examined. The practicality of performing
	      software audits will be discussed, with the size
	      of <a href="http://bitcoinarmory.com/">Armory's</a> code as an
	      example. A small, offline bitcoin wallet implementation will be
	      demonstrated and auditability examined. The presentation will
	      conclude with the potential useful role for self-programmable
	      retro computers under more paranoid circumstances.

    	    <h5 class="speaker">Michael Legary of Seccuris Labs</h5>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      Mike will discuss areas of experimentation and research for NFC and
	      RFID harvesting including the best ways to make your own long range
	      antennas for NFC reading, and the most interesting hardware builds
	      that you can create to harvest data for close or wide range target
	      applications. Physical hardware examples will be made available
	      throughout the day for experimentation.

    	    <h4 class="title">Security Metaphors &mdash; Discussing problems with others while avoiding arguments</h4>
    	    <h5 class="speaker">Josh More</h5>
    	    <p class="abstract">
              There is a divide between the so-called "security/technical"
	      people and the "business" people. We've all heard about how we
	      need to "speak the language of business" and "get soft skills" to
	      succeed. However, even after decades of trying, the divide still
	      exists. Why does it seem that we never make progress? Are we truly
	      not improving? Is the goal receding as we chase it?
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      This presentation posits that we've been making a fundamental error
	      in trying to explain things to people outside our field. One thing
	      that people-oriented people do naturally and technically-oriented
	      people do not is communicate with others using the target's
	      metaphors. By taking this approach and translating issues into
	      different frames of reference, more time is spent exploring the
	      issue instead of arguing over why it matters.
    	    </p>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      By focusing first on being understood and second on the specific
	      issues, rapport can be built and, over time, you can get the
	      resources you need to win more battles.

    	    <h5 class="speaker">Ian Trump</h5>
    	    <p class="abstract">
	      An analysis of the current FUD surrounding the Cyber Threat
	      Intelligence industry. The presentation will explore how you get
	      to call yourself one and illustrate how a lot of folks are making
	      a lot of money "guessing" about the bad guys. The presentation
	      will illustrate how Cyber Threat Intelligence will possibly,
	      maybe, perhaps, perchance, conceivably, feasibly, imaginably,
	      plausibly, give your organization success in fending off
	      cyber-attacks. The presentation will take a light hearted look at
	      the future of Cyber Threat Intelligence and how guessing enough
	      times will statistically increase the likelihood you will get
	      something right. The conclusion will allow for audience
	      participation as we walk through a cyber-crisis and decide if the
	      Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst should be "fired" or "hired",
	      Donald Trump style.

    	    <p class="abstract">
	      Solid state storage devices provide many performance improvements
	      but they also change how data is managed at the physical
	      layer. Those changes lead to new opportunities for the extraction
	      of sensitive data. This talk will outline how SSDs work, how they
	      are managed, how this can be exploited, and what we can do to
	      mitigate the risks.
